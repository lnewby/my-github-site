Children's Hospital Los Angeles partnered with our team at the University of Southern California to make breathing exercises fun for children with cystic fibrosis. We combined Oculus VR headsets with a custom designed digital spirometer to detect inhalation and exhalation, producing a gaming experience like no other.
